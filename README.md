## Get Started
- Fork this repo
- git clone `https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/LearnToCode.git`
- Start local mongodb server
- cd LearnToCode
- npm run setup:dev

If everything goes right, you should be able to see you browser pointing to http://localhost:4200

When you run `npm run setup:dev` for the first time, it will take some time as it will internally trigger `npm install`. And setup your local mongo db with required initial data.
Once packages are installed, it will start a live development server.
